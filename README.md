# Vin√≠cius Porfirio Purgato
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

In this project, I analyzed [data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) from Our World in Data, and took some vailable insights from it, some of them are:
* The day we had more deaths was January 20th, 2021, the pandemic hasn't gotten better.
* Burundi is the country with the least death per million people, even though they have 11.5M living there.
* Qatar has the world's highest GDP per capita.
* The USA is the country with the highest amount of death.
* Israel is the place with most vaccinated people, taking in consideration the nations size.
* Canada had its death rate by Covid-19 increasing, until vaccination started to take place, then it dropped drastically.
* Central African Republic has the lowest GDP per capita in the world, however it had only 63 deaths out of 5M people living there.
